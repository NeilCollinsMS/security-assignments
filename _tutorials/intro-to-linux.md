# Part 1. Linux shell primers

First, complete [this introduction to Google Cloud Platform tutorial]( {{ '/tutorials/intro-to-gcp.html' | relative_url }}),
up to but not including the deliverable, to set up your Kali Linux instance for
use in the rest of Part 1.


## Part 1.1. Complete a gentle introduction to the Linux terminal

Once you have your Kali Linux instance set up in GCP, open a terminal Window in Kali by clicking the terminal icon in the application dock:

{% include lab-image.html image='Kali-dock.jpg' %}

Next, using the terminal in Kali, complete pages 1â€“19 of [this gentle introduction to the Linux terminal, aka shell](https://linuxjourney.com/lesson/the-shell).

Alternatively, Udacity
has a [free set of follow-along video lecture demonstrations](https://www.udacity.com/course/linux-command-line-basics--ud595)
that you might prefer instead.

## Part 1.2. Text manipulation

In addition to the above tutorial, complete the following short pages
from [this set about text manipulation](https://linuxjourney.com/lesson/stdout-standard-out-redirect#)

	* 1. stdout
	* 2. stdin
	* 3. stderr
	* 4. pipe and tee
	* 15. wc and nl
	* 16. grep


## Part 1.3. Learn a text editor

You can use text editors to edit text files from a shell.
Search for and complete an introductory tutorial to a command-line text editor,
such as [this one for `nano`](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/42980/the-beginners-guide-to-nano-the-linux-command-line-text-editor/).

{% if site.instructorcollab_username == 'deargle' %}
I use `vim` because I'm l33t. But I don't recommend that you use vim unless you
enjoy insane learning curves and l33t-ism. If you are morbidly curious,
[see the vim tutorial here](https://danielmiessler.com/study/vim/)

# Part 2. Play the Bandit wargame on OvertheWire.org

Play the [Bandit wargame on OvertheWire.org](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/). Start at Level 0 and complete Level 15 (which gives you the password for Level 16).

To play, you'll need to connect to the Bandit server using an SSH client. SSH stands for **S**ecure **SH**ell, and allows you to remotely control a server using a command line interface. SSH is secure because your connection to the server is encrypted using a symmetric cipher like AES. It also uses asymmetric cryptography such as RSA to establish the server's identity.


## Using SSH on Windows

If you're using Windows, open a PowerShell window by typing `powershell` in Windows search and pressing enter.

Enter the username (bandit0), server address, and port (2220) into PowerShell like so:

{% include lab-image.html image='powershell-connection.png' %}

The password is `bandit0`.

The first time you connect to a server, SSH tells you that you haven't connected to this server before, and shows you a "fingerprint" of the server. Every server should have a unique fingerprint. To learn more about verifying SSH fingerprints, see [here](https://www.phcomp.co.uk/Tutorials/Unix-And-Linux/ssh-check-server-fingerprint.html).

To continue logging in, type `yes` (that's three letters: y-e-s) and press `enter`.


## Using SSH on MacOS

If you're using a Mac, open `Terminal.app` and use the `ssh` command to connect to the Bandit server, like so:

`ssh -p 2220 bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org`

When you first connect to a sever using SSH, you'll see a message like the following:

{% include lab-image.html image='ssh-warning.png' %}

This message tells you that you haven't connected to this server before. The Bandit server is using a ECDSA asymmetric key pair, which is similar to RSA. The fingerprint is a hash of the server's public key. To learn more about verifying SSH fingerprints, see [here](https://www.phcomp.co.uk/Tutorials/Unix-And-Linux/ssh-check-server-fingerprint.html).

To continue logging in, type `yes` (that's three letters: y-e-s) and press `enter`.

## Instructions

* When you type in your password, you won't see any characters. This is a security feature to prevent [shoulder surfing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder_surfing_(computer_security)). Enter the password `bandit0` and press `enter` to login.
* Start at [Level 0](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html) which requires you to login to the Bandit server using SSH. Next, visit [the Level 0 -> Level 1](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit1.html) for instructions on how to get to the next level. Continue until you successfully complete [Level 15 -> Level 16](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit16.html), which gives you the password for Level 16.
* Use the `man` command and search the web to learn about the recommended commands (i.e., "Commands you may need to solve this level") to help you reach the next level. Learning for yourself how to use new commands is a key part of this tutorial.


# Deliverable

{% if site.instructorcollab_username == 'deargle' %}

Make it all the way to level 16. When you have reached level 16, prove it by taking a screenshot of your ssh terminal session showing:
* you logged in as `bandit16@bandit` in the prompt.
* your name
* the date.

For example:

{% include lab-image.html image='bandit-level-16-deliverable.png' %}


{% elsif site.instructorcollab_username == 'aov' %}
For each level you complete, take a screenshot of your terminal screen showing the following:

* Show the password for the next level.
* Run the `date` command to show the current date.
* Print out our name like so: `echo "Your name"`

Add all of the screenshots to Word document and submit the document in the Linux tutorial quiz on Canvas.
